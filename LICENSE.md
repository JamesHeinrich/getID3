getID3 is released under multiple licenses. You may choose from the following licenses, and use getID3 according to the terms of the license most suitable to your project.  
Copies of each of the below licenses are included in the `licenses/` directory of the getID3 distribution.  

__Can I use getID3() in my program? Do I need a commercial license?:__
  _You're generally free to use getID3 however you see fit. The only case in which you would require a commercial license is if you're selling your closed-source program that integrates getID3. If you sell your program including a copy of getID3, that's fine as long as you include a copy of the sourcecode when you sell it. Or you can distribute your code without getID3 and say "download it from getid3.sourceforge.net"_
