Known Bugs/Issues in getID3() that may be fixed eventually
==========================================================

<http://www.getid3.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=25>

* Cannot determine bitrate for MPEG video with VBR video data
  (need documentation)
* Interlace/progressive cannot be determined for MPEG video
  (need documentation)
* MIDI playtime is sometimes inaccurate
* AAC-RAW mode files cannot be identified
* WavPack-RAW mode files cannot be identified
* mp4 files report lots of "Unknown QuickTime atom type"
   (need documentation)
* Encrypted ASF/WMA/WMV files warn about "unhandled GUID
  ASF_Content_Encryption_Object"
* Bitrate split between audio and video cannot be calculated for
  NSV, only the total bitrate. (need documentation)
* All Ogg formats (Vorbis, OggFLAC, Speex) are affected by the
  problem of large VorbisComments spanning multiple Ogg pages, but
  but only OggVorbis files can be processed with vorbiscomment.
* The version of "head" supplied with Mac OS 10.2.8 (maybe other
  versions too) does only understands a single option (-n) and
  therefore fails. getID3 ignores this and returns wrong md5_data.
